# Components

Components are reusable elements that can be used in modules.

Each component would contain any styles, scripts and templates needed to implement the component.
A component would only be used as a building block for a module, never used as a module itself as it should have no defined context for usage. e.g. a **carousel** could be a component but a **used car carousel** would be a module which uses the carousel component. 

Examples would be buttons, dropdowns, accordions, carousels etc.
